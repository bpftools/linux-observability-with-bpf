# Chapter 6: BPF-Based Traffic Control Classifier

- A full description of this example can be found in Chapter 6.
- Please remember that the examples here are tested in the Vagrant machine. Please read more in [README.md](/README.md).
- Make sure to change the example accordingly if you wish to build somewhere else, open an issue if you have problems doing so!
- All the dependencies are already handled if you followed the instructions in the main [README.md](/README.md).


In the machine:

Enter into this example folder:

```bash
cd ~/linux-observability-with-bpf/code/chapter-6/tc-flow-bpf-cls
```

Build the program

```bash
cp ./* /root/lcm/linux-source/linux-4.18/samples/bpf

cd /root/lcm/linux-source/linux-4.18/samples/bpf
make

```

It will create an ELF file named `lcm_classifier_kern.o`

Now, since this example is using Traffic Control as a loader, we don't need to build a loader
ourselves but we just use the `load.sh` script that uses `tc` to load the program on an interface
passed as first argument.

You can use it like this on the loopback (`eth0`), or any other interface (`lo`, `eth1` etc..):

```bash
sudo ./load.sh eth0
```

Since the program `lcm_classifier_kern.c` writes with `bpf_trace_printk` it will dump the output to `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe`.

The classifier is written in a way that everytime an HTTP packet goes trough that interface it will print `Yes! It is HTTP!`.

If you now do an http request to any HTTP server, e.g

```bash
python3 -m http.server

#use another mechine
curl http://eth0Ip:8000
```

It will show:

```
[vagrant@bpfbook tc-flow-bpf-cls]$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe
          <idle>-0     [000] ..s. 30096.619165: 0: Yes! It is HTTP!
```


At this point, you will want to unload the program, to do so:

```bash
sudo ./unload.sh eth0
```
